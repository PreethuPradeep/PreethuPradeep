# Hi, I’m Preethu 👋

Backend-focused **.NET Developer** building workflow-driven systems with an emphasis on  
**correctness, auditability, and explicit domain logic**.

I work primarily with **C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server and Angular**,  
and enjoy designing stateful backend systems that model real-world business processes rather than basic CRUD flows.


I completed my **Full Stack .NET Developer Certification** at Faith Infotech Academy (Dec 2025) and am actively seeking **Junior Backend Developer (.NET)** opportunities while building production-style personal projects.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- Building a **Full-Stack Auditorium Booking System** with Angular, ASP.NET Core, and SQL Server 
- Designing a **manager approval workflow** for time-based bookings with overlap detection and role-based access  
- Implementing **audit-friendly data models** for booking status changes, cancellations, and approvals  
- Practicing structured development using GitHub Issues, milestones, and PR-based workflows

## 🚀 Featured Project: Auditorium Booking System

A workflow-driven booking platform designed to model real-world operational constraints in event and venue management.

**Key highlights**
- Public booking requests with time-slot selection (AM/PM, minute-level precision)  
- Manager approval and rejection flow with role-based access control  
- Overlap detection with manual override support  
- Booking state transitions (Requested → Approved → Rejected / Cancelled)  
- Persistent audit trail for status changes and manager actions  
- Mobile-first UI designed for accessibility and large-font usability

## 💬 About Me
I transitioned into software development from a Civil Engineering background and enjoy breaking down real-world operational problems into **clear, testable, and maintainable backend systems**.

I’m especially interested in domains where **correctness, traceability, and data integrity** matter more than shipping features fast.
